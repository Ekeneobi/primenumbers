(6 points)
# a) 
Ask the user for an input number. The input number should be a positive integer number. Please check if the input number is a positive integer number greater than 1. If not, print that the input is invalid and ask the user to input a valid number.
# b) 
Then it should be determined, whether the number is a prime number or not. Display a statement, if the number is a prime number or not.
# c)
If the input is not a prime number, explain why it is not a prime and display the previous as well as the next prime number.
Hint: A prime number is a positive integer number larger 1, which divisors are just 1 and the number itself.
# 1.2 
Same Task as in 1.1, but this time with the use of functions. You may use the published stub file.
